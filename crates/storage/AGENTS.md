# AGENTS.md — aoide-storage

## Invariants

- **Stage files are read/written through `fs`/`stage`, never ad hoc.** A new
  consumer that wants a JSON file under the stage tree adds a typed
  accessor here rather than `serde_json::from_str`-ing a raw path elsewhere.
- **`takes`/`mode` are a deliberate charter smudge, not an oversight.** Don't
  "clean them up" into a paint-adjacent crate without re-reading
  `docs/architecture/PACKAGE-LAYOUT.md`'s "Charter exceptions" note — `mode`
  is read by `shellbridge` (which stays in `conduct`), so moving it would
  create the cross-crate edge the split exists to avoid.
- **Test env mutation is serialized.** Any test touching
  `AOIDE_STAGE_DIR`/`AOIDE_STATE_DIR` (or similar process-global env) takes
  this crate's `env_lock()` (delegates to `aoide-test-support`).
- **The identity private key never enters a `Serialize`/`Deserialize` type
  (P-P1, `docs/architecture/PAIRING.md`'s kill-list) — mechanically held,
  not prose-only.** `identity::Keypair` holds the raw `SigningKey` and
  derives nothing serializable from it except `IdentityInfo` (public
  material only). `identity.rs`'s own `no_private_material_in_any_serialize_type`
  test reads that file's source and fails the build if a future
  `#[derive(Serialize)]` struct there grows a key-shaped field name. A new
  field on `IdentityInfo` (or a new serializable type anywhere in
  `identity.rs`) that could plausibly carry key material gets checked
  against this test before it lands, not after.
- **`fs::atomic_write_private` is the ONE way a sensitive file gets written
  in this crate** (`identity.rs`'s `ed25519.key` is its first caller) —
  atomic write, then locked to `0600`, mirroring `aoide-secrets`'s
  `home::secure_file` discipline for one file rather than a whole home
  directory. A future sensitive file in this crate routes through it
  rather than hand-rolling its own `atomic_write_bytes` + `set_permissions`
  pair.
- **`ledger` is append-only and never a lookup key for live state (P-D8).**
  `append_ledger_entry` only ever opens `state/session-ledger.jsonl` in
  append mode — nothing in this crate truncates, rewrites, or prunes it;
  that is precisely what makes it survive `sessions.json`'s own pruning.
  Don't add a "compact the ledger" or "delete old entries" path without
  re-reading `docs/architecture/AOIDED.md`'s "L5" — the design leans on
  this file staying a complete, permanent record.

## Extension points

- **A new durable record shape** adds a type to `records` and a read/write
  pair to `fs`/`stage`; existing consumers never touch raw file paths for it.
- **A new CLI verb** (this crate has two groups today, `usage` and `inbox
  list|read|clear`) adds a `cmd!`/`register` entry in `commands.rs`, wired
  into the owning app crate's `commands::all()`.

## Docs update required in the same commit

- This `README.md` when a new module or stage-file shape is added.
- `CONTRACTS.md §4`/`§7` when a stage-file or peer-registry wire shape
  changes.
- `pkgs/aoide/crates/AGENTS.md` for cross-crate invariants (registry order,
  golden discipline) — not restated here.
