# aoide-server

`aoided` and the door serve-loops: A2A JSON-RPC/HTTP/SSE, MCP-over-stdio,
listeners, sessions, snapshots, the audit sink. Untrusted input stops here —
the inbound half of the two-door contract (the outbound half is
`aoide-client`).

## Named seams (what it exposes)

- `daemon` — the `aoided` policy skeleton and `run` entry point.
- `mcp` — `serve_stdio`, the MCP stdio server.
- `a2a` — the serve half of A2A (JSON-RPC/HTTP/SSE); the client half stays
  in `aoide-client`. Two `message/send` arms, two different relationships to
  the inbox (messaging plan P-C6, `state/inbox.json`): `do_inject` (Inject,
  an EXISTING session) delivers through `aoide_conduct::graph::session_send`
  — the same door `graph send` uses — which is where a delivered message
  gets filed; `do_inject` itself files no entry of its own, since its
  Invocation can only ever reach `session_send`'s LOCAL branch (see
  `do_inject`'s doc comment). `do_spawn` (Spawn, a BRAND-NEW session) types
  the opening turn via `spawn_inject_prompt`, which files ITS OWN entry
  right after the write — a spawned session has no `SessionRecord` yet at
  that moment, so it cannot reach `session_send` at all (see
  `spawn_inject_prompt`'s doc comment for the race that rules it out).
  These are the only two inbox-filing call sites in the whole tree.
- `commands` — this crate's CLI verbs: `daemon`, `shellbridge` (registration
  only — the files stay in `conduct`), `a2a serve`.

## What it consumes

`aoide-protocol`, `aoide-storage`, `aoide-conduct`. `aoide-client` is a
dev-dependency only (one round-trip test) — production code never calls
into the outbound client from here.

## How it composes

Sits above `conduct` (reads/writes session state via `do_inject`/`do_spawn`/
`tasks/get`) and `storage`. **The registry-parameter seam**: `mcp::serve_stdio`
and `a2a::serve` take the assembled `Registry` and dispatcher as parameters
rather than reaching for a crate-global singleton — that singleton doesn't
exist until the app crate (`cli`/`lyra`) assembles it, and `server → cli`
would invert the dependency direction the whole split exists to forbid.
