//! shellbridge's socket loop — the session/hook state bridge
//! (concepts/shellbridge).
//!
//! Registers agent sessions + window addresses and records Claude Code hook
//! phases, publishing them to `song/stage/` for Quickshell to read. Writes are
//! atomic (write-temp-then-rename) so a hot-reload never sees a torn file
//! (CONTRACTS.md §4 discipline).
//!
//! The process seeds the stage files (atomic writer), then binds its unix
//! socket and serves newline-delimited JSON commands: a widget click sends
//! `{ "cmd": "focuswindow", "address": "0x…" }` and shellbridge dispatches the
//! Hyprland focus (the Terminal-Commander session-jump flow). The accept loop
//! is robust: a malformed line, an unknown command, or a dropped connection is
//! logged and skipped — nothing ever kills the service.
//!
//! Moved here from root `src/shellbridge.rs` (Phase 3b restructure,
//! docs/architecture/PACKAGE-LAYOUT.md) — ONLY the socket-loop half
//! (`socket_path`, `BridgeCommand`, `parse_command`, `run`); the stage-file FS
//! substrate (`stage_dir`, `atomic_write`, `with_stage_lock`, …) already
//! moved to `aoide-storage` in Phase 3a and stays there. Root re-exports both
//! halves at their old `crate::shellbridge::*` path so no caller changes.
