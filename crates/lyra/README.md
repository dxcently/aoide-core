# aoide-lyra (bin `lyra`)

The paint app crate — the second composition root over the same
domain-crate handler code `aoide-cli` assembles (P-A4). In Cordis terms
(CONTRACTS.md §0): a BUNDLE, same as `cli` — its own ordered
`commands::all()` profile over an independent `Registry`. Owns the
self-ricing loop, `screen`, `herald`, `shellbridge`, and `quickshell`;
deliberately never conducting, the graph, A2A, peers, or the daemon (those
are core `aoide` identity, root `AGENTS.md`).

## Named seams (what it exposes)

- `bin/lyra` — the binary entry point.
- `dispatch`/`registry` — lyra's own argv parsing, dispatch, and golden
  command-path snapshot (42 paths), independent of core's.
- `guide` — `lyra guide`.
- `commands` — lyra's `commands::all()`, pulling in `song`, `screen`, and
  `conduct`'s `shellbridge`/`herald` registration lines (the files stay in
  `conduct`; only the registry lines are lyra's).
- `run_lyra` — drives `aoide_protocol::door::run` with lyra's own registry/
  dispatcher and its own smaller `special` hook (`mcp serve --stdio`,
  `guide`/`schema`/`livery` raw output). Deliberately absent: `a2a serve`,
  `conductor`.

## What it consumes

`aoide-protocol`, `aoide-song`, `aoide-conduct` (for the `shellbridge`/
`herald` registry lines), `aoide-screen`, `aoide-server` (for `mcp
serve --stdio`'s door loop).

## How it composes

42 command paths: rice/draft/mode/cover/livery/quickshell/screen/
shellbridge/herald/take — everything that paints, or that only a desktop
needs. Never depends on `aoide-client`/`aoide-conductor` — no A2A client, no
TUI; those stay core-only. May depend on Nix (`song::widgets`'s `nix eval`)
— the one binary allowed to (root `AGENTS.md`, "core is nix-independent").
